# Release History

You're supposed to use github by using git to commit code as you work on things and shit, but uh fuck that. I never started out coding like that and have never seen fit to start doing versioning control that way, especially when I'd rather keep code private and to myself until it's actually ready for use. This of course means that I make test builds along the way for people to use, usually in the form of uploading a prepatched ROM to a Discord channel, and this never get mentioned or documented elsewhere.

For that reason, here is a full list of versions, including hashs of each version, for posterity. I won't be providing patches for them because they are old versions not really worth using, and a curiosity at best. This is mostly if you have an old version and want to identify it, I guess.
